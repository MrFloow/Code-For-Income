## Trading Strategies

This repository supports various trading strategies. Here are a few you can implement:

### Arbitrage Trading

Arbitrage trading involves buying and selling an asset on different exchanges to profit from price discrepancies. Set your bot to scan multiple exchanges and execute trades when it finds an opportunity.

### Trend Following

Trend following strategies focus on identifying the direction of the market and making trades in that direction. You can use moving averages or other indicators to help your bot make decisions.

### Mean Reversion

Mean reversion strategies assume that prices will revert to their mean over time. Your bot can buy when prices are low and sell when they are high.

### Scalping

Scalping involves making small profits from frequent trades. Your bot can execute a large number of trades within a short period, capturing small price movements.
